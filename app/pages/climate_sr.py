        "The impacts of climate change are felt by most critical systems, such  as infrastructure, ecological systems, "

        "for assessing effects this localized. Local scale projections can be obtained using statistical downscaling, "
        "a technique which uses historical climate observations to learn a low-resolution to high-resolution mapping. "
        "Depending on statistical modeling choices, downscaled projections have been shown to vary significantly in "
        "terms of accuracy and reliability. The spatio-temporal nature of the climate system motivates the adaptation "
        "of super-resolution image processing techniques to statistical downscaling."
