        "Digital image resampling occupies a small but important place in the fields of image processing and computer "
        "graphics. In the most basic terms, resampling is the process of geometrically transforming digital images. "

        "Digital image resampling has its beginnings in the early ’70s. Catmull [1974] was the first in the field of "
        "computer graphics to work on texture mapping, when he discovered a way to map images onto curved surfaces. "
        "Rifman, McKinnon, and Bernstein [Keys, 1981; Park and Schowengerdt, 1983] did some of the first work on "
        "resampling for correction of remotely sensed image data (satellite imagery) around the same time."
    )
    st.markdown(
        "Resampling finds uses in many fields. It is usually a step in a larger process, seldom an end in itself and "
        "is most often viewed as a means to an end. In computer graphics resampling allows texture to be applied to "
        "surfaces in computer generated imagery, without the need to explicitly model the texture. In medical and "
        "remotely sensed imagery it allows an image to be registered with some standard co-ordinate system, be it "
        "another image, a map, or some other reference. This is primarily done to prepare for further processing."
    )
    st.markdown(
        "Resampling is essentially a mathematical operation mapping one collection of numbers into another. "
        "The important point here is that what is seen by a human to be the input to and output from the resampling "
        "process are continuous representations of the underlying discrete images. There are many different ways of "
        "reconstructing a continuous image from a discrete one."
    )
    st.markdown(
        "What's a discrete and what's a continuous image? Continuous images have a real intensity at every point in "
        "the real plane. The image that is presented to a human eye or to a video camera, before any processing is "
        "done to it, is a continuous image. Discrete images only have intensity values at a set of discrete points and "
        "these intensities are drawn from a set of discrete values. The image stored in a computer display’s frame "
        "buffer is a discrete image. The discrete values are often called ‘pels’ or ‘pixels’ (contractions of "
        "'picture elements')."

        "One of the simpler ways of increasing image size is nearest-neighbor interpolation, replacing every pixel "
        "with the nearest pixel in the output; for upscaling this means multiple pixels of the same color will be "
        "present. This can preserve sharp details in pixel art, but also introduce jaggedness in previously smooth "
        "images. 'Nearest' in nearest-neighbor doesn't have to be the mathematical nearest. One common "
        "implementation is to always round towards zero. Rounding this way produces fewer artifacts and is faster "
        "to calculate.",
        "Spline interpolations are relatively fast, based on polynomial interpolation of order $n$ with $n-1$ "
        "continuous derivatives. Bilinear interpolation works by interpolating pixel color values, introducing a "
        "continuous transition into the output even where the original material has discrete transitions. "
        "Although this is desirable for continuous-tone images, this algorithm reduces contrast (sharp edges) in a "
        "way that may be undesirable for line art. Bicubic interpolation yields substantially better results, with "
        "an increase in computational cost.",

        "One weakness of bilinear, bicubic and related algorithms is that they sample a specific number of pixels. "
        "When down scaling below a certain threshold, such as more than twice for all bi-sampling algorithms, the "
        "algorithms will sample non-adjacent pixels, which results in both losing data, and causes rough results. "
        "The trivial solution to this issue is box sampling, which is to consider the target pixel a box on the "
        "original image, and sample all pixels inside the box. This ensures that all input pixels contribute to "
        "the output. The major weakness of this algorithm is that it is hard to optimize.",

        "perfectly bandlimited signal. In practice, the assumptions behind sinc resampling are not completely met by "
