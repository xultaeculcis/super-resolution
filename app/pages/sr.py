        "pleasing to the human eye."
    )
    st.markdown(
        "* **Perceptual Loss**: Perceptual loss tries to match the high-level features in a generated image with "

        "of feature outputs between predicted and output images as loss. This loss function is introduced in SRGAN."

    st.markdown(
